The concept for this plugin has evolved. I'm going to abandon it and release something similar but better. Read about that [here](https://github.com/octopress/category-index/issues/2#issuecomment-77193081).

**TL:DR**: Most of the time HTML should ship with CSS. This is the sort of plugin that makes most sense with a theme. However it would be really nice to be able to have these features without having use a theme, so I'm going to build a version that uses templates from your local site source. That way you'll be able to use your own HTML and your own CSS but get the advantages of easy category and tag indexes, as well as built-in multilingual support.

I haven't begun this plugin yet, but all of the plumbinig is already built into Octopress Ink, so it shouldn't take long once I have time to begin.
